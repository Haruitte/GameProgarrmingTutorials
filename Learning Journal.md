# Learning Journal
## Week One Goals
### Main aim for week one (8/10/24):
Drafts for potential tutorials = 
  - Brainstorm what would be needed in final year game project.
  - Identify main concepts of each idea.
  - Translate into code.

Learning Journal made

## Week Two Goal
### Coverage of Week two designs (15/10/24):

First task: folowing draft tutorial by Paul to develop understanding of Tutorial making.
Main takeaway's:
  - Give student base concept of what code does.
  - Illustrate clearly what is dont in order: Identify clear stepping points for new learners.
  - Give feedback within tutoial: I.e, outline what should happen, make tutorial respond.
      - i.e. Tutorial for damage: have item change colour during damage.
  - Make tutorial digestable: break down int each part: explain key points.

### Ideas for Tutorials
Since we can only have four tutorials, these ideas willl be drafted and picked depenending on how I want to use them
in conjuction to how important I see them to my final game plan and idea:

  - Charging Meter: Install mechanics.
  - 3D Movement (Including Jumping).
  - Double Jump Tutorial.
  - Dash Tutorial.
  - Block Tutorial.
  - Camera Movement.
  - Parry Mechanics.

Potential ideas may be merged depending on time and if i believe they link together strongly.
Ideas may be removed as well if they are either:
  - not important/ not immediately relevant to final game
  - issues in my own understanding for coding behind the concept

First Idea for coding: Install System/Meter
  - will most likley be a system used in the final game plan as part of in game combat and idle states

## Week Three Goals
### Looking at tutorials and starting first (22/10/24)

First task changed:
First tutorial wil be movement instead of meters/install.
  - Movement will be core part of Final project
  - Healthbar will cover basics of meter tutorial
